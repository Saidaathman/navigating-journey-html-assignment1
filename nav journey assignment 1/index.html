<P>Trevor Noah was born to a white swiss father and a black xhosa mother whereby Trevor was a mixed race and his mother was a black woman.His mum was a deeply religious woman.It was a forced thing due to the colonizers during apartheid period.His grandmother balanced between religious faith and traditional xhosa beliefs,communicating with the spirits of their ancestors.Later other black people abandoned their faith for christianity as they saw white people pray to a guy who turns water into wine which made sense into them.</P>

 <p>His childhood involved going to church atleast four times a week with his mother.Tuesday night was for <strong>Prayer meetings,</strong>,Wednesday night was for<strong>Bible study</strong>,Thursday night was <strong>Youth church</strong>.Friday and Saturday was <em>Time to sin!</em>.Sunday was for going to church.The more he went to church the more he gained knowledge about christianity.They went to different churches because each church gave them new experiences and different things.The first church offered<em>jubilant praise of the Lord</em>.The second church offered <em>deep analysis of the scripture</em>.The third church offred <em>passion and catharsis</em>.The churches had their own distinct racial makeup:jubilant church;mixed church,analytical;white church,black church;passionate and catheartic church.

 <br>
 <p>Trevor loved going to church what he does not like  is the distance between one church and another as they had to attend all types of churches on that  on that same day.In mixed church there was a<em>christian karaoke</em>
 which made a blast performance and making Jesus <em>cool</em>his favourite church was the white church because he did not have to go to the main service.;In sunday he got to read cool stories eg<strong>Noah and the flood</strong>.Black church were slow and would take hours since time was moving so slowly until Trevor Noah decided<i>black people need more time with jesus because they suffered more</i>.The interesting part in black church was about pastor casting out demons and followers would start running up and down like mad men,screaming in tongues.</p>

<p>One sunday after they have all prepared to go to church their car refused to start and trevor prayed they would remain at home but due to her mothers stubborness she had already made up her mind to go and catch minibuses.she told him "The devil does not want them to go to church.Thats why they have to catch minibuses".After they had finished with their rounds they did not find any minibuses to take them back home.under apartheid the government provided no transportation for blacks,but white people still needed them to show up for work.They created their own transportation system and divided themselves,but still violence and corruption was seen as they could fight over routes.After waiting for a while Trevor and his mum decided to stroll luckily they found a car and was offered a ride.without knowing what trouble they had gotten themselves into.A car swerved infront of them and they were in deep trouble they begged the africans not to kill the driver as it not his wish to carry them later they got into the minibus of africans.They began harassing her with her tribe which was xhosa calling her unfaithful.After several insults they told us they would teach them a lesson.Trevors mother had to jump out of a running car together with the children for them not to be raped or killed.They ran so fast since trevors mother had worn awards from racing.They were later helped my policemen.Trevor was told that it was Gods plan and had a reason he started arguing saying that"Look mom i know you love jesus but next time ask him to meet at our house cause it was not fun at all".</p>

<br> 
<p>They also argued  using bible verses if there were minor disputes both at school and at home.He also attended a catholic school in which there were rules about communion at friday mass which made no sense in him.When he was not allowed to take the communion he stole and eat all of it.Trevor celebrated christmass with his dad showing that they were true followers of jesus christ.

<p>In life in order to achieve anything you want God always comes out first in anything.</p>
